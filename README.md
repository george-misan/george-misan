### Hi, Earthlings ðŸ‘‹

I am a ~~basketballer~~ software engineer that understands the software development life cycle from design to implementation. My superpowers include `UX / UI design`, `front-end development`(which includes a high level of proficiency in Typescript, React, Redux, CSS, SASS etc.), and a good technical understanding of `backend development` (i.e, SQL, Node, Rust, MongoDB). I am enthusiastic about creating clean, user-centric & functional web applications that solve real-world problems.
