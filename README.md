### Hi, Earthlings 👋

I am a full-stack designer that understands the software development life cycle from design to implementation and deployment. My superpowers include UX / UI design, front-end development (which includes a high level of proficiency in JS frameworks, SASS, LESS & CSS Grid system), and a good technical understanding of backend. I am enthusiastic about creating clean, user-centric & functional web applications that solve real-world problems.
