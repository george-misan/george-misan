### Hi I am George Misan ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack designer that understands the entire software development process from concept to design and development. My superpowers include UX / UI design, front-end development (which includes a high level of proficiency in JS frameworks, SASS, LESS & CSS Grid system), and a good technical understanding of backend. I am enthusiastic about creating clean, user-centric & functional web applications that solve real-world problems.
